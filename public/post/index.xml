      <description>Background The Brier Score is a composite measure of discrimination and calibration for a prediction model. The Brier Score is defined as
\[ BS = \frac{1}{N} \sum (y_i - \hat y_i)^2, \]
where \(N\) is the number of observations, \(y_i\) is the observed outcome, either 0 or 1, and \(\hat y_i\) is the predicted probability for the \(i\)th observation. Let’s create an R function calculate the Brier Score:
brier_score &amp;lt;- function(obs, pred) { mean((obs - pred)^2) } The scaled Brier Score accounts for the event rate and provides an immediate comparison to an uninformative model that is equivalent to “just guess the event rate.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the blog post originally posted on babelgraph.org on March 25, 2011. The relevant hyperlinks and igraph code have been updated to reflect the current state of things. The edgelist, despite many more intervening seasons, and thus many more romances, has not been updated. Here is a nice walkthrough of ERGMs based on this post &amp;ndash; sorry for the broken link, Ben.
This all began with an introductory presentation about social network analysis to a group of medical students.</description>
