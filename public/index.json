The Brier Score is defined as\n\\[ BS = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum (y_i - \\hat y_i)^2, \\]\nwhere \\(N\\) is the number of observations, \\(y_i\\) is the observed outcome, either 0 or 1, and \\(\\hat y_i\\) is the predicted probability for the \\(i\\)th observation. Let’s create an R function calculate the Brier Score:\nbrier_score \u0026lt;- function(obs, pred) { mean((obs - pred)^2) } The scaled Brier Score accounts for the event rate and provides an immediate comparison to an uninformative model that is equivalent to “just guess the event rate.” An intuitive way to define the scaled Brier Score (also called the “Brier skill score”) is\n\\[ BS_{scaled} = 1 - \\frac{BS}{BS_{max}}, \\]\nwhere \\(BS_{max} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum (y_i - \\bar y_i)^2\\) and \\(\\bar y_i\\) is the event rate among the observed outcome.\n My confusion This formulation of the scaled Brier Score makes intuitive sense to me and is how I go about calculating it in practice. However, two other distinct formulations have been proposed for calculating \\(BS_{max}\\) that — at least to the limits of my algebraic skills – differ. Thus, here I proposed a numeric investigation of these different definitions to see if they are indeed equivalent.\n Definition 1 This is the intuitive definition to which I am accustomed, and is made explicit here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29713202\n\\[ BS_{scaled} = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum (y_i - \\hat y_i)^2}{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum (y_i - \\bar y_i)^2}. \\]\nLet’s create an R function to calculate this value.\nscaled_brier_score_1 \u0026lt;- function(obs, pred) { 1 - (brier_score(obs, pred) / brier_score(obs, mean(obs))) }  Definition 2 A second formulation of the scaled Brier Score is defined with a slightly different definition of \\(BS_{max}\\), which is in this case described in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20010215\n\\[ BS_{max} = \\hat p \\times (1 - \\hat p). \\]\nLet’s create an R function to calculate this measure.\nscaled_brier_score_2 \u0026lt;- function(obs, pred) { 1 - (brier_score(obs, pred) / (mean(obs) * (1 - mean(obs)))) }  Definition 3 A third formulation of the scaled Brier Score is defined with a slightly different definition of \\(BS_{max}\\), which is in this case described in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22961910\n\\[ BS_{max} = \\hat p \\times (1 - \\hat p)^2 + (1 - \\hat p) \\times \\hat p^2. \\]\nLet’s create an R function to calculate this measure.\nscaled_brier_score_3 \u0026lt;- function(obs, pred) { 1 - (brier_score(obs, pred) / (mean(obs) * (1 - mean(obs))^2 + (1 - mean(obs)) * mean(obs)^2)) }  Build a model Let’s build a sample model based on the UCI abalone data (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone).\n# get data df \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026#39;https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data\u0026#39;) names(df) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026#39;sex\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;length\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;diameter\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;height\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;weight_whole\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;weight_shucked\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;weight_viscera\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;weight_shell\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rings\u0026#39;) # inspect data knitr::kable(head(df))   sex length diameter height weight_whole weight_shucked weight_viscera weight_shell rings    M 0.350 0.265 0.090 0.2255 0.0995 0.0485 0.070 7  F 0.530 0.420 0.135 0.6770 0.2565 0.1415 0.210 9  M 0.440 0.365 0.125 0.5160 0.2155 0.1140 0.155 10  I 0.330 0.255 0.080 0.2050 0.0895 0.0395 0.055 7  I 0.425 0.300 0.095 0.3515 0.1410 0.0775 0.120 8  F 0.530 0.415 0.150 0.7775 0.2370 0.1415 0.330 20    # Let\u0026#39;s predict whether or not an abalone will have \u0026gt; 10 rings m1 \u0026lt;- glm(I(rings \u0026gt; 10) ~ ., data = df, family = binomial) preds_m1 \u0026lt;- predict(m1, type = \u0026#39;response\u0026#39;) # And another model with severe class imablance m2 \u0026lt;- glm(I(rings \u0026gt; 3) ~ ., data = df, family = binomial) ## Warning: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred preds_m2 \u0026lt;- predict(m2, type = \u0026#39;response\u0026#39;)  Score the model # ---------- Model 1 # Calculate the Brier Score brier_score(df$rings \u0026gt; 10, preds_m1) ## [1] 0.1479862 # Calculate each type of scaled Brier Score scaled_brier_score_1(df$rings \u0026gt; 10, preds_m1) ## [1] 0.3462507 scaled_brier_score_2(df$rings \u0026gt; 10, preds_m1) ## [1] 0.3462507 scaled_brier_score_3(df$rings \u0026gt; 10, preds_m1) ## [1] 0.3462507 # ---------- Model 2 # Calculate the Brier Score brier_score(df$rings \u0026gt; 3, preds_m2) ## [1] 0.002690905 # Calculate each type of scaled Brier Score scaled_brier_score_1(df$rings \u0026gt; 3, preds_m2) ## [1] 0.3362851 scaled_brier_score_2(df$rings \u0026gt; 3, preds_m2) ## [1] 0.3362851 scaled_brier_score_3(df$rings \u0026gt; 3, preds_m2) ## [1] 0.3362851  ","date":1555977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556067994,"objectID":"84a76f3c896e4797207fe1ff0ec5b2d3","permalink":"/post/evaluating-the-equivalence-of-different-formulations-of-the-scaled-brier-score/","publishdate":"2019-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/evaluating-the-equivalence-of-different-formulations-of-the-scaled-brier-score/","section":"post","summary":"Background The Brier Score is a composite measure of discrimination and calibration for a prediction model.

The relevant hyperlinks and igraph code have been updated to reflect the current state of things. The edgelist, despite many more intervening seasons, and thus many more romances, has not been updated. Here is a nice walkthrough of ERGMs based on this post \u0026ndash; sorry for the broken link, Ben.\nThis all began with an introductory presentation about social network analysis to a group of medical students. What better way to grab their attention than with attractive, fake doctors having sex on television? Naturally this led to the dense network of sexual contacts between characters on the Grey’s Anatomy television show. After viewing many hours of previous episodes and exploring fan pages (especially here for an early attempt at a graph representation of sexual contacts), I was able to come up with an extensive but by no means exhaustive list of contacts. The edge list is available here.\nThis example uses the igraph package for R, both free to download. First we create the graph, give it a layout, and plot.\nlibrary(igraph) ga.data \u0026lt;- read.csv('ga_edgelist.csv', header = TRUE) g \u0026lt;- graph.data.frame(ga.data, directed=FALSE) summary(g) g$layout \u0026lt;- layout.fruchterman.reingold(g) plot(g)  Without knowing who is represented by each vertex, what can you deduce from the graph? From a public health perspective, if you could test one person for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), who would it be? If you could provide counseling and a free box of condoms to one person, who would it be? If you knew that an epidemic was spreading through this network, who would you want to be to best avoid it?\nNow let’s make the visualization a little more interesting. First we can remove the labels for now, and then change the size of the vertex to represent the degree, or degree centrality, corresponding to the number of partners of each vertex. In the context of transmissible infections, this would indicate the number of people a person could infect or be infected by through sexual contact.\nV(g)$label \u0026lt;- NA # remove labels for now V(g)$size \u0026lt;- degree(g) * 2 # multiply by 2 for scale plot(g)  This tells us about the absolute number of partners, but not much about the relative position within the network. Let’s examine two types of centrality: closeness and betweenness. The closeness centrality is the average shortest path from one vertex to every other on the graph. A high number indicates that a vertex is quickly reachable by the majority of vertices in the graph, while a low number indicates that the vertex is far from most other vertices on the graph. We can calculate the centrality and then rescale the values to create a color scheme to visualize the relative differences.\nclo \u0026lt;- closeness(g) # rescale values to match the elements of a color vector clo.score \u0026lt;- round( (clo - min(clo)) * length(clo) / max(clo) ) + 1 # create color vector, use rev to make red \u0026quot;hot\u0026quot; clo.colors \u0026lt;- rev(heat.colors(max(clo.score))) V(g)$color \u0026lt;- clo.colors[ clo.score ] plot(g)  It appears there are a few vertices on the red “hot” end of the spectrum, and a few at the “cold” end. Next we do the same for each vertex to calculate the betweenness centrality, which is the number of shortest paths on the network that pass through the vertex. Vertices with high betweenness centrality might be thought of as serving a gatekeeper role in mediating the shortest connections between other vertices.\nbtw \u0026lt;- betweenness(g) btw.score \u0026lt;- round(btw) + 1 btw.colors \u0026lt;- rev(heat.colors(max(btw.score))) V(g)$color \u0026lt;- btw.colors[ btw.score ] plot(g)  This last graph of betweenness indicates slightly more variation among the likely suspects, while the analysis of closeness centrality demonstrated less variation. Why?\nA useful technique in social network analysis is the use of community finding algorithms. Here we use the implementation of the Girvan-Newman algorithm (paper here) to detect the underlying community structure of the graph. We will iterate through each merge to determine which cut produces the maximum modularity, and then use that number to calculate the groups.\n# this section has been substantially revised to reflect the # newer version of igraph which does GN membership easily V(g)$color \u0026lt;- membership(cluster_edge_betweenness(g)) V(g)$size \u0026lt;- 15 # reset to default size plot(g) # those new default igraph colors are so much nicer, too!  Once you see the graph with names, it is interesting to note the breaks in connectivity around race and age (I guess you have to know the TV characters to appreciate this ;) ) So before seeing the names, back to the original question. Who would you test? Who would you counsel? Who would you vaccinate? Who would you rather be?\nAnd the winners are…\nV(g)$color \u0026lt;- 'grey' V(g)$label \u0026lt;- V(g)$name V(g)$label.cex \u0026lt;- 0.7 # rescale the text size of the label plot(g)  ","date":1497484800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556067994,"objectID":"37fc9011f34f7a12f94f2f3bbeac8aeb","permalink":"/post/grey-s-anatomy-network-of-sexual-relations/","publishdate":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/grey-s-anatomy-network-of-sexual-relations/","section":"post","summary":"Here\u0026rsquo;s the blog post originally posted on babelgraph.org on March 25, 2011.

I suspect the twitter API and much of the code below are not up to date.\nI am a recent comer to twitter, and it took me a few weeks to figure out what this was all about. Who are all these people tweeting each other and what do all these trending hashtags mean? Do these people all know each other? How do they get involved in these conversations? Are people really talking/listening to each other, or just spewing 140 character projectiles out into the void?\nThis piqued my interest in the structure of relationships of participants in different twitter conversations. Using R, with the twitteR and igraph packages, I wondered what I would find\u0026hellip;\nIn terms of mapping twitter networks with R, I found this post for mapping one’s own personal network of connections. For other visualizations, I found a collection of various visualizations for the twitterverse, and an interactive map of connected users.\nHere I am really interested in the network of participants in a particular conversation. I started off with “#Rstats,” expecting to see a tightly knit community of users who all seem to know each other (at least virtually), sending each other personal updates or tech support tweets. Next I looked at “#Libya,” where I imagined there would be a lot of twitterers with massive followings, but who were unlikely following each other, and producing hordes of news-type updates. Finally I looked at “#Bieber,” (I swear didn’t even know who he was up until a few weeks ago), where I expected to see platoons of small-time twitterers, who likely don’t follow each other, pouring out disconnected digital adulations into the twitterverse.\nThe following script was used to construct the networks for each search item.\n# an R script to generate the social network of contributors # to a particular search term # author: Gary Weissman # twitter: @garyweissman # choose a conversation and size of search search.term \u0026lt;- '#Rstats' search.size \u0026lt;- 50 # load required libraries library(igraph) library(twitteR) # get recent results from search search.results \u0026lt;- searchTwitter(search.term,n=search.size) # build the vertex list vl \u0026lt;- vector() for (twt in search.results) vl \u0026lt;- c(vl,screenName(twt)) # calculate contribution of each user in the conversation vl \u0026lt;- as.data.frame(table(vl)) # provide nice names for data colnames(vl) \u0026lt;- c('user','tweets') # build the network of relations between contributors g \u0026lt;- graph.empty(directed=TRUE) g \u0026lt;- add.vertices(g,nrow(vl),name=as.character(vl$user), tweets=vl$tweets) V(g)$followers \u0026lt;- 0 # default to zero # count total number of followers in the larger twitterverse and # add relationships based on who follows whom within the conversation for (usr in V(g)) { # get the user info by name tuser \u0026lt;- getUser(V(g)$name[usr+1]) print(paste(\u0026quot;Getting info on\u0026quot;,screenName(tuser))) # count total followers in larger twitterverse V(g)$followers[usr+1] \u0026lt;- followersCount(tuser) # access as many followers as we can to see if any # appeared in the search results followers.list \u0026lt;- userFollowers(tuser,n=1200) for (tflwr in followers.list) { if (screenName(tflwr) %in% V(g)$name) g \u0026lt;- add.edges(g,c(as.vector(V(g)[ name == screenName(tflwr) ]),usr)) } print('Sleeping 10 min...') Sys.sleep(600); # don't exceed request limit } # layout the graph g$layout \u0026lt;- layout.fruchterman.reingold(g) # adjust size based on number of total followers # scale accordingly to keep readable V(g)$size = log( V(g)$followers ) * 1.8 # set label name and size V(g)$label=V(g)$name V(g)$label.cex = 0.6 # do something with color... tcolors \u0026lt;- rev(heat.colors(max(V(g)$tweets))) V(g)$color \u0026lt;- tcolors[ V(g)$tweets ] # make edge arrows less intrusive E(g)$arrow.size \u0026lt;- 0.3 # make symmetric connections a little easier to read E(g)$curved \u0026lt;- FALSE # fun to play with E(g)$color \u0026lt;- 'blue' # now plot... plot(g)  Technical notes: It wasn’t always clear to me what counted as a “request” in the twitter API, because even a small handful of requests with long results would sometimes seem to count as more toward the hourly quota. Putting a ten minute delay between requests with Sys.sleep(600) was enough to solve the problem. I also tweaked the layouts a bit using tkplot.getcoords(). NB. tkplot() does not permit certain graph attributes such as label.vertex.cex, so you have to remove it before opening the graph in tkplot. You can then just add it back later. More details on this tkplot issue here.\nThe size of the vertex is proportional to the log of the number of followers in the wider twitterverse, and the color of vertex represents the number of tweets found in the search results by that user. See code above for specifics.\n#Bieber\n#Libya\n#Rstats\nThe networks obviously look very different. Here is a plot of the degree distribution of each graph:\nEven more interesting is the simple comparison of the number of edges in each graph. Very telling.\nI did not look at the clustering coefficient here, but that would be interesting, too.\nDoes this mean that R users are part of a twitter community?\nLimitations on this approach include the size of the user sample (limited by the twitter API to 150 requests per hour), as well as limits on the size of lists retrieved by the userFriends() method (I believe the limit is 1200 items). These former limits the sample size significantly, and provides only a brief snapshot in time of the participants in any one conversation. The latter favors the construction of edges between twitterers with fewer followers, thus understestimating the total edges that may exist in the network. Is there a workaround for these limitations on the API? I believe requesting whitelist status from twitter, or perhaps authenticating with ROAuth would increase the number of permitted requests, but I haven’t tried them yet.\nDo you know to whom you tweet?\n","date":1497484800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1497484800,"objectID":"e73486bd40f80a4c177c37a1ecf87fb8","permalink":"/post/the-structure-of-twitter-participant-relationships-in-conversations-around-libya-bieber-and-rstats/","publishdate":"2017-06-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/the-structure-of-twitter-participant-relationships-in-conversations-around-libya-bieber-and-rstats/","section":"post","summary":"Here\u0026rsquo;s the blog post originally posted on babelgraph.org on April 4, 2011.
